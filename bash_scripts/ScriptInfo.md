These scripts are the first version of the finalized scripts.
They are used to create users, create groups, add users to groups, and install packages (apache) necessary to run an Apache web server.
They are Ubuntu based and were tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

Scripts were written by Colin Vo for Linux Server final project.
